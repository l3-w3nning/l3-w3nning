- 👋 Hi, I’m @l3-w3nning
- 👀 I’m interested in math, physics and quantitative finance. Apart from things that you can share on github I also am passionate for sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about pricing of exotic options and am getting into weather derivatives (also professionally) (currently working on a project to price FX-quanto options with copulas)
- 💞️ I’m looking to get input and feedback for my projects, knowing that there is probably tons to improve
